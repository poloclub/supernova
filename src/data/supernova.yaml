  description: 'Data scientists have embraced computational notebooks to author analysis
    code and accompanying visualizations within a single document. Currently, although
    these media may be interleaved, they remain siloed: interactive visualizations
    must be manually specified as they are divorced from the analysis provenance expressed
    via dataframes, while code cells have no access to users'' interactions with visualizations,
    and hence no way to operate on the results of interaction. To bridge this divide,
    we present B2, a set of techniques grounded in treating data queries as a shared
    representation between the code and interactive visualizations. B2 instruments
    data frames to track the queries expressed in code and synthesize corresponding
    visualizations. These visualizations are displayed in a dashboard to facilitate
    interactive analysis. When an interaction occurs, B2 reifies it as a data query
    and generates a history log in a new code cell. Subsequent cells can use this
    log to further analyze interaction results and, when marked as reactive, to ensure
    that code is automatically recomputed when new interaction occurs. In an evaluative
    study with data scientists, we find that B2 promotes a tighter feedback loop between
    coding and interacting with visualizations. All participants frequently moved
    from code to visualization and vice-versa, which facilitated their exploratory
    data analysis in the notebook.'

  description: Interfaces for machine learning (ML), information and visualizations
    about models or data, can help practitioners build robust and responsible ML systems.
    Despite their benefits, recent studies of ML teams and our interviews with practitioners
    (n=9) showed that ML interfaces have limited adoption in practice. While existing
    ML interfaces are effective for specific tasks, they are not designed to be reused,
    explored, and shared by multiple stakeholders in cross-functional teams. To enable
    analysis and communication between different ML practitioners, we designed and
    implemented Symphony, a framework for composing interactive ML interfaces with
    task-specific, data-driven components that can be used across platforms such as
    computational notebooks and web dashboards. We developed Symphony through participatory
    design sessions with 10 teams (n=31), and discuss our findings from deploying
    Symphony to 3 production ML projects at Apple. Symphony helped ML practitioners
    discover previously unknown issues like data duplicates and blind spots in models
    while enabling them to share insights with other stakeholders.

  description: Exploratory data science largely happens in computational notebooks
    with dataframe APIs, such as pandas, that support flexible means to transform,
    clean, and analyze data. Yet, visually exploring data in dataframes remains tedious,
    requiring substantial programming effort for visualization and mental effort to
    determine what analysis to perform next. We propose Lux, an always-on framework
    for accelerating visual insight discovery in dataframe workflows. When users print
    a dataframe in their notebooks, Lux recommends visualizations to provide a quick
    overview of the patterns and trends and suggests promising analysis directions.
    Lux features a high level language for generating visualizations on demand to
    encourage rapid visual experimentation with data. We demonstrate that through
    the use of a careful design and three system optimizations, Lux adds no more than
    two seconds of overhead on top of pandas for over 98% of datasets in the UCI repository.
    We evaluate Lux in terms of usability via a controlled first-use study and interviews
    with early adopters, finding that Lux helps fulfill the needs of data scientists
    for visualization support within their dataframe workflows. Lux has already been
    embraced by data science practitioners, with over 3.1k stars on Github.

  description: Interactive visualization via direct manipulation has inherent design
    trade-offs in flexibility, discoverability, and ease-of-use. Scripting languages
    can support a vast range of user queries and tasks, but may be more cumbersome
    for free-form exploration. Embedding interactive visualization in a scripting
    environment, such as a computational notebook, provides an opportunity for leveraging
    the strengths of both direct manipulation and scripting. We conduct a design study
    investigating this opportunity in the context of calling context trees as used
    for performance analysis of parallel software. Our collaborators make new performance
    analysis functionality available to users via Jupyter notebook examples, making
    the project setting conducive to such an investigation. Through a series of semi-structured
    interviews and regular meetings with project stakeholders, we produce a formal
    task analysis grounded in the expectation that tasks may be supported by scripting,
    interactive visualization, or both paradigms. We then design an interactive bivariate
    calling context tree visualization for embedding in Jupyter notebooks with features
    to pass data and state between the scripting and visualization contexts. We evaluated
    our embedded design with seven high performance computing experts. The experts
    were able to complete tasks and provided further feedback on the visualization
    and the notebook-embedded interactive visualization paradigm. We reflect upon
    the project and discuss factors in both the process and the design of the embedded
    visualization.

  description: The ever-growing datasets in observational astronomy have challenged
    scientists in many aspects, including an efficient and interactive data exploration
    and visualization. Many tools have been developed to confront this challenge.
    However, they usually focus on displaying the actual images or focus on visualizing
    patterns within catalogs in a predefined way. In this paper we introduce Vizic,
    a Python visualization library that builds the connection between images and catalogs
    through an interactive map of the sky region. Vizic visualizes catalog data over
    a custom background canvas using the shape, size and orientation of each object
    in the catalog. The displayed objects in the map are highly interactive and customizable
    comparing to those in the observation images. These objects can be filtered by
    or colored by their property values, such as redshift and magnitude. They also
    can be sub-selected using a lasso-like tool for further analysis using standard
    Python functions and everything is done from inside a Jupyter notebook. Furthermore,
    Vizic allows custom overlays to be appended dynamically on top of the sky map.
    We have initially implemented several overlays, namely, Voronoi, Delaunay, Minimum
    Spanning Tree and HEALPix grid layer, which are helpful for visualizing large-scale
    structure. All these overlays can be generated, added or removed interactively
    with just one line of code. The catalog data is stored in a non-relational database,
    and the interfaces have been developed in JavaScript and Python to work within
    Jupyter Notebook, which allows to create customizable widgets, user generated
    scripts to analyze and plot the data selected/displayed in the interactive map.
    This unique design makes Vizic a very powerful and flexible interactive analysis
    tool. Vizic can be adopted in variety of exercises, for example, data inspection,
    clustering analysis, galaxy alignment studies, outlier identification or just
    large scale visualizations.

  description: Pyvis is a Python module that enables visualizing and interactively
    manipulating network graphs in the Jupyter notebook, or as a standalone web application.
    Pyvis is built on top of the powerful and mature VisJS JavaScript library, which
    allows for fast and responsive interactions while also abstracting away the low-level
    JavaScript and HTML. This means that elements of the rendered graph visualization,
    such as node/edge attributes can be specified within Python and shipped to the
    JavaScript layer for VisJS to render. This declarative approach makes it easy
    to quickly explore graph visualizations and investigate data relationships. In
    addition, Pyvis is highly customizable so that colors, sizes, and hover tooltips
    can be assigned to the rendered graph. The network graph layout is controlled
    by a front-end physics engine that is configurable from a Python interface, allowing
    for the detailed placement of the graph elements. In this paper, we outline use
    cases for Pyvis with specific examples to highlight key features for any analysis
    workflow. A brief overview of Pyvis' implementation describes how the Python front-end
    binding uses simple Pyvis calls.

  description: Interactive visualization interfaces are critical in data analysis.
    Yet creating new interfaces is challenging, as the developer must understand the
    queries needed for the desired analysis task, and then design the appropriate
    interface. Existing task models are too abstract to be used to automatically generate
    interfaces, and visualization recommenders do not take the queries nor interactions
    into account. PI2 is the first system to generate fully functional interactive
    visualization interfaces from a representative sequence of task queries. PI2 analyzes
    queries syntactically and proposes a novel Difftree representation that encodes
    the systematic variations between query abstract syntax trees. PI2 then poses
    interface generation as a schema mapping problem from each Difftree to a visualization
    that renders its results, and the variations encoded in each Difftree to interactions
    in the interface. Interface generation further takes the layout and screen size
    into account. Our user studies show that PI2 interfaces are comparable to or better
    than those designed by developers, and that PI2 can generate exploration interfaces
    that are easier to use than the state-of-the-art SQL notebook products. What's
    more, PI2 generates high-quality interfaces within a few seconds.

  description: As machine learning (ML) systems become increasingly widespread, it
    is necessary to audit these systems for biases prior to their de-ployment. Recent
    research has developed algorithms for effectively identifying intersectional bias
    in the form of interpretable, underper-forming subsets (or slices) of the data.
    However, these solutions and their insights are limited without a tool for visually
    understanding and interacting with the results of these algorithms. We propose
    Visual Auditor, an interactive visualization tool for auditing and summarizing
    model biases. Visual Auditor assists model validation by providing an interpretable
    overview of intersectional bias (bias that is present when examining populations
    defined by multiple features), details about relationships between problematic
    data slices, and a comparison between underperforming and overper-forming data
    slices in a model. Our open-source tool runs directly in both computational notebooks
    and web browsers, making model auditing accessible and easily integrated into
    current ML development workflows. An observational user study in collaboration
    with domain experts at Fiddler AI highlights that our tool can help ML practitioners
    identify and understand model biases.

  description: Modern machine learning techniques commonly rely on complex, high-dimensional
    embedding representations to capture underlying structure in the data and improve
    performance. In order to characterize model flaws and choose a desirable representation,
    model builders often need to compare across multiple embedding spaces, a challenging
    analytical task supported by few existing tools. We first interviewed nine embedding
    experts in a variety of fields to characterize the diverse challenges they face
    and techniques they use when analyzing embedding spaces. Informed by these perspectives,
    we developed a novel system called Emblaze that integrates embedding space comparison
    within a computational notebook environment. Emblaze uses an animated, interactive
    scatter plot with a novel Star Trail augmentation to enable visual comparison.
    It also employs novel neighborhood analysis and clustering procedures to dynamically
    suggest groups of points with interesting changes between spaces. Through a series
    of case studies with ML experts, we demonstrate how interactive comparison with
    Emblaze can help gain new insights into embedding space structure.

  description: Visual analytics is arguably the most important step in getting acquainted
    with your data. This is especially the case for time series, as this data type
    is hard to describe and cannot be fully understood when using for example summary
    statistics. To realize effective time series visualization, four requirements
    have to be met; a tool should be (1) interactive, (2) scalable to millions of
    data points, (3) integrable in conventional data science environments, and (4)
    highly configurable. We observe that open source Python visualization toolkits
    empower data scientists in most visual analytics tasks, but lack the combination
    of scalability and interactivity to realize effective time series visualization.
    As a means to facilitate these requirements, we created Plotly-Resampler, an open
    source Python library. Plotly-Resampler is an add-on for Plotly's Python bindings,
    enhancing line chart scalability on top of an interactive toolkit by aggregating
    the underlying data depending on the current graph view. Plotly-Resampler is built
    to be snappy, as the reactivity of a tool qualitatively affects how analysts visually
    explore and analyze data. A benchmark task highlights how our toolkit scales better
    than alternatives in terms of number of samples and time series. Additionally,
    Plotly-Resampler's flexible data aggregation functionality paves the path towards
    researching novel aggregation techniques. Plotly-Resampler's integrability, together
    with its configurability, convenience, and high scalability, allows to effectively
    analyze high-frequency data in your day-to-day Python environment.

  description: In this demo paper we present ST_VISIONS, an easy-to-use Python library
    for interactive visualizations of spatial and spatio-temporal datasets. By automating
    the low-level details of the underlying visualization library (Bokeh), ST_VISIONS
    allows data scientists to create interactive, map-based visualizations, by writing
    Python code at a higher level of abstraction. Consequently, we accelerate the
    task of visualization from different sources, while we support interactive filtering,
    colorization, as well as multiple graphs, for various types of spatial and spatio-temporal
    data.

  description: In recent years, a wide variety of automated machine learning (AutoML)
    methods have been proposed to generate end-to-end ML pipelines. While these techniques
    facilitate the creation of models, given their black-box nature, the complexity
    of the underlying algorithms, and the large number of pipelines they derive, they
    are difficult for developers to debug. It is also challenging for machine learning
    experts to select an AutoML system that is well suited for a given problem. In
    this paper, we present the Pipeline Profiler, an interactive visualization tool
    that allows the exploration and comparison of the solution space of machine learning
    (ML) pipelines produced by AutoML systems. PipelineProfiler is integrated with
    Jupyter Notebook and can be combined with common data science tools to enable
    a rich set of analyses of the ML pipelines, providing users a better understanding
    of the algorithms that generated them as well as insights into how they can be
    improved. We demonstrate the utility of our tool through use cases where PipelineProfiler
    is used to better understand and improve a real-world AutoML system. Furthermore,
    we validate our approach by presenting a detailed analysis of a think-aloud experiment
    with six data scientists who develop and evaluate AutoML tools.

  description: Network analysis has been applied in diverse application domains. We
    consider an application from protein dynamics, specifically residue interaction
    networks (RINs). While numerous RIN visualization tools exist, there are no solutions
    that are both easily programmable and as fast as optimized network analysis toolkits.
    In this work, we use NetworKit - an established package for network analysis -
    to build a cloud-based environment that enables domain scientists to run their
    visualization and analysis workflows on large compute servers, without requiring
    extensive programming and/or system administration knowledge. To demonstrate the
    versatility of this approach, we use it to build a custom Jupyter-based widget
    for RIN visualization. In contrast to existing RIN visualization approaches, our
    widget can easily be customized through simple modifications of Python code, while
    both supporting a comprehensive feature set and providing near real-time speed.
    Due to its integration into Jupyter notebooks, our widget can easily interact
    with other popular packages of the Python ecosystem to build custom analysis pipelines
    (e.g., pipelines that feed RIN data into downstream machine learning tasks).

  description: Analyzing classification model performance is a crucial task for machine
    learning practitioners. While practitioners often use count-based metrics derived
    from confusion matrices, like accuracy, many applications, such as weather prediction,
    sports betting, or patient risk prediction, rely on a classifier's predicted probabilities
    rather than predicted labels. In these instances, practitioners are concerned
    with producing a calibrated model, that is, one which outputs probabilities that
    reflect those of the true distribution. Model calibration is often analyzed visually,
    through static reliability diagrams, however, the traditional calibration visualization
    may suffer from a variety of drawbacks due to the strong aggregations it necessitates.
    Furthermore, count-based approaches are unable to sufficiently analyze model calibration.
    We present Calibrate, an interactive reliability diagram that addresses the aforementioned
    issues. Calibrate constructs a reliability diagram that is resistant to drawbacks
    in traditional approaches, and allows for interactive subgroup analysis and instance-level
    inspection. We demonstrate the utility of Calibrate through use cases on both
    real-world and synthetic data. We further validate Calibrate by presenting the
    results of a think-aloud experiment with data scientists who routinely analyze
    model calibration.

  description: Data wrangling is a difficult and time-consuming activity in computational
    notebooks, and existing wrangling tools do not fit the exploratory workflow for
    data scientists in these environments. We propose a unified interaction model
    based on programming-by-example that generates readable code for a variety of
    useful data transformations, implemented as a Jupyter notebook extension called
    Wrex. User study results demonstrate that data scientists are significantly more
    effective and efficient at data wrangling with Wrex over manual programming. Qualitative
    participant feedback indicates that Wrex was useful and reduced barriers in having
    to recall or look up the usage of various data transform functions. The synthesized
    code allowed data scientists to verify the intended data transformation, increased
    their trust and confidence in Wrex, and fit seamlessly within their cell-based
    notebook workflows. This work suggests that presenting readable code to professional
    data scientists is an indispensable component of offering data wrangling tools
    in notebooks.

  description: Finding the similarities and differences between groups of datasets
    is a fundamental analysis task. For high-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction
    (DR) methods are often used to find the characteristics of each group. However,
    existing DR methods provide limited capability and flexibility for such comparative
    analysis as each method is designed only for a narrow analysis target, such as
    identifying factors that most differentiate groups. This paper presents an interactive
    DR framework where we integrate our new DR method, called ULCA (unified linear
    comparative analysis), with an interactive visual interface. ULCA unifies two
    DR schemes, discriminant analysis and contrastive learning, to support various
    comparative analysis tasks. To provide flexibility for comparative analysis, we
    develop an optimization algorithm that enables analysts to interactively refine
    ULCA results. Additionally, the interactive visualization interface facilitates
    interpretation and refinement of the ULCA results. We evaluate ULCA and the optimization
    algorithm to show their efficiency as well as present multiple case studies using
    real-world datasets to demonstrate the usefulness of this framework.

    can pick the desired one. From this kind of feedback, we can then, in principle,
    continuously learn and improve the system. Given that plotting is widely used

    However, developing visualization NLIs remains a challenging task, requiring low-level
    implementation of natural language processing (NLP) techniques as well as knowledge
    of visual analytic tasks and visualization design. We present NL4DV, a toolkit
    for natural language-driven data visualization. NL4DV is a Python package that
    takes as input a tabular dataset and a natural language query about that dataset.
    In response, the toolkit returns an analytic specification modeled as a JSON object
    containing data attributes, analytic tasks, and a list of Vega-Lite specifications
    relevant to the input query. In doing so, NL4DV aids visualization developers
    who may not have a background in NLP, enabling them to create new visualization
    NLIs or incorporate natural language input within their existing systems. We demonstrate
    NL4DV''s usage and capabilities through four examples: 1) rendering visualizations
    using natural language in a Jupyter notebook, 2) developing a NLI to specify and
    edit Vega-Lite charts, 3) recreating data ambiguity widgets from the DataTone
    system, and 4) incorporating speech input to create a multimodal visualization
    system.'

  description: 'The Simplex algorithm for solving linear programs---one of Computing
    in Science & Engineering''s top 10 most influential algorithms of the 20th century---is
    an important topic in many algorithms courses. While the algorithm relies on intuitive
    geometric ideas, the computationally-involved mechanics of the algorithm can obfuscate
    a geometric understanding. In this paper, we present gilp, an easy-to-use Simplex
    algorithm visualization tool designed to connect the mechanical steps of the algorithm
    with their geometric interpretation. We provide an extensive library of example
    visualizations, and our tool allows instructors to quickly produce custom interactive
    HTML files for students to experiment with the algorithm (without requiring students
    to install anything!). The tool can also be used for interactive assignments in
    Jupyter notebooks, and has been incorporated into a forthcoming Data Science and
    Decision Making interactive textbook. In this paper, we first describe how the
    tool fits into the existing algorithm visualization literature: how it was designed
    to facilitate student engagement and instructor adoption, and how it substantially
    extends existing algorithm visualization tools for Simplex. We then describe the
    development and usage of the tool, and report feedback from its use in a course
    with roughly 100 students. Student feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with
    students finding the tool easy to use: it effectively helped them link the algebraic
    and geometrical views of the Simplex algorithm and understand its nuances. Finally,
    gilp is open-source, includes an extension to visualizing linear programming-based
    branch and bound, and is readily amenable to further extensions.'

  description: Virtual Research Environments (VREs) provide user-centric support in
    the lifecycle of research activities, e.g., discovering and accessing research
    assets, or composing and executing application workflows. A typical VRE is often
    implemented as an integrated environment, which includes a catalog of research
    assets, a workflow management system, a data management framework, and tools for
    enabling collaboration among users. Notebook environments, such as Jupyter, allow
    researchers to rapidly prototype scientific code and share their experiments as
    online accessible notebooks. Jupyter can support several popular languages that
    are used by data scientists, such as Python, R, and Julia. However, such notebook
    environments do not have seamless support for running heavy computations on remote
    infrastructure or finding and accessing software code inside notebooks. This paper
    investigates the gap between a notebook environment and a VRE and proposes an
    embedded VRE solution for the Jupyter environment called Notebook-as-a-VRE (NaaVRE).
    The NaaVRE solution provides functional components via a component marketplace
    and allows users to create a customized VRE on top of the Jupyter environment.
    From the VRE, a user can search research assets (data, software, and algorithms),
    compose workflows, manage the lifecycle of an experiment, and share the results
    among users in the community. We demonstrate how such a solution can enhance a
    legacy workflow that uses Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data from country-wide
    airborne laser scanning surveys for deriving geospatial data products of ecosystem
    structure at high resolution over broad spatial extents. This enables users to
    scale out the processing of multi-terabyte LiDAR point clouds for ecological applications
    to more data sources in a distributed cloud environment.

  description: Automatic evaluation of text generation tasks (e.g. machine translation,
    text summarization, image captioning and video description) usually relies heavily
    on task-specific metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE. They, however, are abstract
    numbers and are not perfectly aligned with human assessment. This suggests inspecting
    detailed examples as a complement to identify system error patterns. In this paper,
    we present VizSeq, a visual analysis toolkit for instance-level and corpus-level
    system evaluation on a wide variety of text generation tasks. It supports multimodal
    sources and multiple text references, providing visualization in Jupyter notebook
    or a web app interface. It can be used locally or deployed onto public servers
    for centralized data hosting and benchmarking. It covers most common n-gram based
    metrics accelerated with multiprocessing, and also provides latest embedding-based
    metrics such as BERTScore.

  description: Graph data have become increasingly common. Visualizing them helps
    people better understand relations among entities. Unfortunately, existing graph
    visualization tools are primarily designed for single-person desktop use, offering
    limited support for interactive web-based exploration and online collaborative
    analysis. To address these issues, we have developed Argo Lite, a new in-browser
    interactive graph exploration and visualization tool. Argo Lite enables users
    to publish and share interactive graph visualizations as URLs and embedded web
    widgets. Users can explore graphs incrementally by adding more related nodes,
    such as highly cited papers cited by or citing a paper of interest in a citation
    network. Argo Lite works across devices and platforms, leveraging WebGL for high-performance
    rendering. Argo Lite has been used by over 1,000 students at Georgia Tech's Data
    and Visual Analytics class. Argo Lite may serve as a valuable open-source tool
    for advancing multiple CIKM research areas, from data presentation, to interfaces
    for information systems and more.

    \ render and enable real-time interactions with \u227310 million particles, and\

    \ for researchers to explore their own data, but can also be useful to communicate\
    \ results to researchers and/or collaborators and as an effective public outreach\
    \ tool. Every element of the user interface can be customized and disabled, enabling\
    \ easy adaptation of the same visualization for different audiences with little\
    \ additional effort. Creating a new Firefly visualization is simple with the provided\
    \ Python data preprocessor that translates input data to a Firefly-compatible\
    \ format and provides helpful methods for hosting instances of Firefly both locally\
    \ and on the internet. In addition to visualizing the positions of particles,\
    \ users can visualize vector fields (e.g., velocities) and also filter and color\
    \ points by scalar fields. We share three examples of Firefly applied to astronomical\
    \ data sets: (1) the FIRE cosmological zoom-in simulations, (2) the SDSS galaxy\
    \ catalog, and (3) Gaia Data Release 3. A gallery of additional interactive demos\

  description: Performing astronomical data analysis using only personal computers
    is becoming impractical for the very large datasets produced nowadays. As analysis
    is not a task that can be automatized to its full extent, the idea of moving processing
    where the data is located means also moving the whole scientific process towards
    the archives and data centers. Using Jupyter Notebooks as a remote service is
    a recent trend in data analysis that aims to deal with this problem, but harnessing
    the infrastructure to serve the astronomer without increasing the complexity of
    the service is a challenge. In this paper we present the architecture and features
    of JOVIAL, a Cloud service where astronomers can safely use Jupyter notebooks
    over a personal space designed for high-performance processing under the high-availability
    principle. We show that features existing only in specific packages can be adapted
    to run in the notebooks, and that algorithms can be adapted to run across the
    data center without necessarily redesigning them.

  description: Machine learning on data streams is increasingly more present in multiple

    learning models to make incorrect decisions. While there are automatic methods
    to detect when drift is happening, human analysis, often by data scientists, is
    essential to diagnose the causes of the problem and adjust the system. We propose
    Data+Shift, a visual analytics tool to support data scientists in the task of
    investigating the underlying factors of shift in data features in the context
    of fraud detection. Design requirements were derived from interviews with data
    scientists. Data+Shift is integrated with JupyterLab and can be used alongside

  description: With new catalogues arriving such as the Gaia DR1, containing more

    This enables efficient exploration or large datasets interactively, making science
    exploration of large catalogues feasible. Vaex is a Python library and an application,

    developing vaex is the catalogue of the Gaia satellite, however, vaex can also
    be used on SPH or N-body simulations, any other (future) catalogues such as SDSS,

  description: Embeddings of high-dimensional data are widely used to explore data,
    to verify analysis results, and to communicate information. Their explanation,
    in particular with respect to the input attributes, is often difficult. With linear
    projects like PCA the axes can still be annotated meaningfully. With non-linear
    projections this is no longer possible and alternative strategies such as attribute-based
    color coding are required. In this paper, we review existing augmentation techniques
    and discuss their limitations. We present the Non-Linear Embeddings Surveyor (NoLiES)
    that combines a novel augmentation strategy for projected data (rangesets) with
    interactive analysis in a small multiples setting. Rangesets use a set-based visualization
    approach for binned attribute values that enable the user to quickly observe structure
    and detect outliers. We detail the link between algebraic topology and rangesets
    and demonstrate the utility of NoLiES in case studies with various challenges
    (complex attribute value distribution, many attributes, many data points) and
    a real-world application to understand latent features of matrix completion in
    thermodynamics.

  description: Collaborations in astronomy and astrophysics are faced with numerous
    cyber-infrastructure challenges, such as large data sets, the need to combine
    heterogeneous data sets, and the challenge to effectively collaborate on those
    large, heterogeneous data sets with significant processing requirements and complex
    science software tools. The cyberhubs system is an easy-to-deploy package for
    small- to medium-sized collaborations based on the Jupyter and Docker technology,
    which allows web-browser-enabled, remote, interactive analytic access to shared
    data. It offers an initial step to address these challenges. The features and
    deployment steps of the system are described, as well as the requirements collection
    through an account of the different approaches to data structuring, handling,
    and available analytic tools for the NuGrid and PPMstar collaborations. NuGrid
    is an international collaboration that creates stellar evolution and explosion
    physics and nucleosynthesis simulation data. The PPMstar collaboration performs
    large-scale 3D stellar hydrodynamics simulations of interior convection in the
    late phases of stellar evolution. Examples of science that is currently performed
    on cyberhubs, in the areas of 3D stellar hydrodynamic simulations, stellar evolution
    and nucleosynthesis, and Galactic chemical evolution, are presented.

  description: "Context: Computational notebooks are a contemporary style of literate\
    \ programming, in which users can communicate and transfer knowledge by interleaving\
    \ executable code, output, and prose in a single rich document. A Domain-Specific\
    \ Language (DSL) is an artificial software language tailored for a particular\
    \ application domain. Usually, DSL users are domain experts that may not have\
    \ a software engineering background. As a consequence, they might not be familiar\
    \ with Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Thus, the development of tools\
    \ that offer different interfaces for interacting with a DSL is relevant. Inquiry:\
    \ However, resources available to DSL designers are limited. We would like to\
    \ leverage tools used to interact with general purpose languages in the context\
    \ of DSLs. Computational notebooks are an example of such tools. Then, our main\
    \ question is: What is an efficient and effective method of designing and implementing\
    \ notebook interfaces for DSLs? By addressing this question we might be able to\
    \ speed up the development of DSL tools, and ease the interaction between end-users\
    \ and DSLs. Approach: In this paper, we present Bacat\xE1, a mechanism for generating\
    \ notebook interfaces for DSLs in a language parametric fashion. We designed this\
    \ mechanism in a way in which language engineers can reuse as many language components\
    \ (e.g., language processors, type checkers, code generators) as possible. Knowledge:\
    \ Our results show that notebook interfaces generated by Bacat\xE1 can be automatically\
    \ generated with little manual configuration. There are few considerations and\
    \ caveats that should be addressed by language engineers that rely on language\
    \ design aspects. The creation of a notebook for a DSL with Bacat\xE1 becomes\
    \ a matter of writing the code that wires existing language components in the\
    \ Rascal language workbench with the Jupyter platform. Grounding: We evaluate\
    \ Bacat\xE1 by generating functional computational notebook interfaces for three\
    \ different non-trivial DSLs, namely: a small subset of Halide (a DSL for digital\
    \ image processing), SweeterJS (an extended version of JavaScript), and QL (a\
    \ DSL for questionnaires). Additionally, it is relevant to generate notebook implementations\
    \ rather than implementing them manually. We measured and compared the number\
    \ of Source Lines of Code (SLOCs) that we reused from existing implementations\
    \ of those languages. Importance: The adoption of notebooks by novice-programmers\
    \ and end-users has made them very popular in several domains such as exploratory\
    \ programming, data science, data journalism, and machine learning. Why are they\
    \ popular? In (data) science, it is essential to make results reproducible as\
    \ well as understandable. However, notebooks are only available for GPLs. This\
    \ paper opens up the notebook metaphor for DSLs to improve the end-user experience\
    \ when interacting with code and to increase DSLs adoption."

  description: Most tabular data visualization techniques focus on overviews, yet
    many practical analysis tasks are concerned with investigating individual items
    of interest. At the same time, relating an item to the rest of a potentially large
    table is important. In this work we present Taggle, a tabular visualization technique
    for exploring and presenting large and complex tables. Taggle takes an item-centric,
    spreadsheet-like approach, visualizing each row in the source data individually
    using visual encodings for the cells. At the same time, Taggle introduces data-driven
    aggregation of data subsets. The aggregation strategy is complemented by interaction
    methods tailored to answer specific analysis questions, such as sorting based
    on multiple columns and rich data selection and filtering capabilities. We demonstrate
    Taggle using a case study conducted by a domain expert on complex genomics data
    analysis for the purpose of drug discovery.

  description: Computational notebooks are a form of computational narrative fostering
    reproducibility. They provide an interactive computing environment where users
    can run and modify code and repeat the exploration, providing an iterative communication
    between data scientists and code. While the ability to execute notebooks non-linearly
    benefits data scientists for exploration, the drawback is that it is possible
    to lose control over the datasets, variables, and methods defined in the notebook
    and their dependencies. Thus, in this process of user interaction and exploration,
    there can be a loss of execution history information. To prevent this, a possibility
    is needed to maintain provenance information. Provenance plays a significant role
    in data science, especially in facilitating the reproducibility of results. To
    this end, we developed a provenance management tool to help data scientists track,
    capture, compare, and visualize provenance information in notebook code environments.
    We conducted an evaluation with data scientists, where participants were asked
    to find specific provenance information from the execution history of a machine
    learning Jupyter notebook. The results from the performance and user evaluation
    show promising aspects of provenance management features of the tool. The resulting
    system, MLProvLab, is available as an open-source extension for JupyterLab.

  description: Computational notebooks are widely used for data analysis. Their interleaved
    displays of code and execution results (e.g., visualizations) are welcomed since
    they enable iterative analysis and preserve the exploration process. However,
    the communication of data findings remains challenging in computational notebooks.
    Users have to carefully identify useful findings from useless ones, document them
    with texts and visual embellishments, and then organize them in different tools.
    Such workflow greatly increases their workload, according to our interviews with
    practitioners. To address the challenge, we designed Notable to offer on-the-fly
    assistance for data storytelling in computational notebooks. It provides intelligent
    support to minimize the work of documenting and organizing data findings and diminishes
    the cost of switching between data exploration and storytelling. To evaluate Notable,
    we conducted a user study with 12 data workers. The feedback from user study participants
    verifies its effectiveness and usability.

    Slide4N with a two-part user study, where participants appreciated this human-AI
    collaborative approach compared to fully-manual or fully-automatic methods. The
    results also indicate the usefulness and effectiveness of Slide4N in slide creation

  description: Visualizations are widely used to communicate findings and make data-driven
    decisions. Unfortunately creating bespoke and reproducible visualizations requires
    the use of procedural tools such as matplotlib. These tools present a steep learning
    curve as their documentation often lacks sufficient usage examples to help beginners
    get started or accomplish a specific task. Forums such as StackOverflow have long
    helped developers search for code online and adapt it for their use. However,
    developers still have to sift through search results and understand the code before
    adapting it for their use.We built a tool called VizSmith which enables code reuse
    for visualizations by mining visualization code from Kaggle notebooks and creating
    a database of 7176 reusable Python functions. Given a dataset, columns to visualize
    and a text query from the user, VizSmith searches this database for appropriate
    functions, runs them and displays the generated visualizations to the user. At
    the core of VizSmith is a novel metamorphic testing based approach to automatically
    assess the reusability of functions, which improves end-to-end synthesis performance
    by 10% and cuts the number of execution failures by 50%.

  description: Causal inference is a statistical paradigm for quantifying causal effects
    using observational data. It is a complex process, requiring multiple steps, iterations,
    and collaborations with domain experts. Analysts often rely on visualizations
    to evaluate the accuracy of each step. However, existing visualization toolkits
    are not designed to support the entire causal inference process within computational
    environments familiar to analysts. In this paper, we address this gap with Causalvis,
    a Python visualization package for causal inference. Working closely with causal
    inference experts, we adopted an iterative design process to develop four interactive
    visualization modules to support causal inference analysis tasks. The modules
    are then presented back to the experts for feedback and evaluation. We found that
    Causalvis effectively supported the iterative causal inference process. We discuss
    the implications of our findings for designing visualizations for causal inference,
    particularly for tasks of communication and collaboration.

  description: Large pre-trained language models such as GPT-3, Codex, and Google's
    language model are now capable of generating code from natural language specifications
    of programmer intent. We view these developments with a mixture of optimism and
    caution. On the optimistic side, such large language models have the potential
    to improve productivity by providing an automated AI pair programmer for every
    programmer in the world. On the cautionary side, since these large language models
    do not understand program semantics, they offer no guarantees about quality of
    the suggested code. In this paper, we present an approach to augment these large
    language models with post-processing steps based on program analysis and synthesis
    techniques, that understand the syntax and semantics of programs. Further, we
    show that such techniques can make use of user feedback and improve with usage.
    We present our experiences from building and evaluating such a tool jigsaw, targeted
    at synthesizing code for using Python Pandas API using multi-modal inputs. Our
    experience suggests that as these large language models evolve for synthesizing
    code from intent, jigsaw has an important role to play in improving the accuracy
    of the systems.

  description: The documentation practice for machine-learned (ML) models often falls
    short of established practices for traditional software, which impedes model accountability
    and inadvertently abets inappropriate or misuse of models. Recently, model cards,
    a proposal for model documentation, have attracted notable attention, but their
    impact on the actual practice is unclear. In this work, we systematically study
    the model documentation in the field and investigate how to encourage more responsible
    and accountable documentation practice. Our analysis of publicly available model
    cards reveals a substantial gap between the proposal and the practice. We then
    design a tool named DocML aiming to (1) nudge the data scientists to comply with
    the model cards proposal during the model development, especially the sections
    related to ethics, and (2) assess and manage the documentation quality. A lab
    study reveals the benefit of our tool towards long-term documentation quality
    and accountability.

  description: Though error analysis is crucial to understanding and improving NLP
    models, the common practice of manual, subjective categorization of a small sample
    of errors can yield biased and incomplete conclusions. This paper codifies model
    and task agnostic principles for informative error analysis, and presents Errudite,
    an interactive tool for better supporting this process. First, error groups should
    be precisely defined for reproducibility; Errudite supports this with an expressive
    domain-specific language. Second, to avoid spurious conclusions, a large set of
    instances should be analyzed, including both positive and negative examples; Errudite
    enables systematic grouping of relevant instances with filtering queries. Third,
    hypotheses about the cause of errors should be explicitly tested; Errudite supports
    this via automated counterfactual rewriting. We validate our approach with a user
    study, finding that Errudite (1) enables users to perform high quality and reproducible
    error analyses with less effort, (2) reveals substantial ambiguities in prior
    published error analyses practices, and (3) enhances the error analysis experience
    by allowing users to test and revise prior beliefs.

  description: Data-centric NLP is a highly iterative process requiring careful exploration
    of text data throughout entire model development lifecycle. Unfortunately, existing
    data exploration tools are not suitable to support data-centric NLP because of
    workflow discontinuity and lack of support for unstructured text. In response,
    we propose Weedle, a seamless and customizable exploratory text analysis system
    for data-centric NLP. Weedle is equipped with built-in text transformation operations
    and a suite of visual analysis features. With its widget, users can compose customizable
    dashboards interactively and programmatically in computational notebooks.

  description: Common pitfalls in visualization projects include lack of data availability
    and the domain users' needs and focus changing too rapidly for the design process
    to complete. While it is often prudent to avoid such projects, we argue it can
    be beneficial to engage them in some cases as the visualization process can help
    refine data collection, solving a "chicken and egg" problem of having the data
    and tools to analyze it. We found this to be the case in the domain of task parallel
    computing where such data and tooling is an open area of research. Despite these
    hurdles, we conducted a design study. Through a tightly-coupled iterative design
    process, we built Atria, a multi-view execution graph visualization to support
    performance analysis. Atria simplifies the initial representation of the execution
    graph by aggregating nodes as related to their line of code. We deployed Atria
    on multiple platforms, some requiring design alteration. We describe how we adapted
    the design study methodology to the "moving target" of both the data and the domain
    experts' concerns and how this movement kept both the visualization and programming
    project healthy. We reflect on our process and discuss what factors allow the
    project to be successful in the presence of changing data and user needs.
